### 1. 📸 `admojo_web_server` — *Cryptographic Proof of Views Engine*

**Goal:** Authenticate real-time visual engagement using blockchain cryptography.

- **ESP32-CAM** securely streams MJPEG video
- Firmware authenticity ensured via SHA256 hashes signed using ECDSA (secp256k1)
- Golang backend (GoCV + OpenCV with SSD/ResNet DNN) detects human faces securely
- Aggregates cryptographically signed viewer counts, submitted securely on-chain

**Highlights:**
- SHA256 hash integrity verification
- IoU filtering prevents duplicate counts
- Real-time cryptographic verification of video feeds

> 🔍 Ads aren’t just viewed; they're cryptographically proven.

### 2. 📲 `admojo_nfc_module` — *Cryptographic Proof of Taps Module*

**Goal:** Ensure user taps are genuine and verifiable via blockchain.

- **ESP32 WROOM + PN532 NFC** securely fetches dynamic campaign URLs
- NFC tags written with NDEF format, secured using ECDSA-signed SHA256 firmware hashes
- Deep sleep cycles protect against interference and fraud

**Cryptographic Security:**
- Secure signing of URLs (ECDSA)
- NFC tags locked with unique cryptographic sector keys

> ✨ Passive views show interest; cryptographically secured taps prove engagement.

### 3. ⚙️ `admojo_compute_node` — *Golang Blockchain Oracle & Verifier*

**Goal:** Provide cryptographically verifiable data directly on Ethereum.

- Authenticates firmware hashes and signatures via Ethereum-compatible ECDSA (secp256k1)
- Real-time verification of SHA256 hashes ensures data integrity
- Aggregates viewer metrics, pushing cryptographically verified data to Ethereum smart contracts

**Core Features:**
- Robust ECDSA signature verification
- Secure integration with Ethereum blockchain
- Immutable on-chain storage of verified metrics

> 🔗 Securely bridging off-chain IoT interactions to Ethereum smart contracts.
